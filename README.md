# Magnetic Resonance K-space Local Low-Rank Estimation for Attenuating Noise (MR KLEAN)

Ludwig S Zhao (ludwigz@seas.upenn.edu)

MR KLEAN is a generalized local low-rank (LLR) denoising framework that operates directly on complex-valued k-space data prior to image reconstruction. It is a robust, acquisition- and reconstruction-agnostic method that is broadly applicable to high-dimensional MRI acquisitions.

This repository contains:
- Denoising pipelines used to generate the manuscript results (ASL, cardiac, and phantom).
- An evolving implementation toward a general-purpose toolbox interface (under development).
